# OOPS based Card Game

This is a simple two-player card game created using OOPS concepts in Python. The game uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and the rules are similar to the classic card game "War."

## Installation

You can download the code from this repository and run it on your local machine. This project requires Python 3.x.

## Game Rules

1. The deck is shuffled and divided equally between two players.
2. Each player plays a card, and the player with the higher card value wins the round.
3. In case of a tie, a "war" is declared, and each player must draw five cards from their deck. The winner of the war is the player with the higher card value after drawing five cards.
4. The game continues until one player has all the cards, and they are declared the winner.

## How to Use

Run the ```cardgame.py``` file in your preferred Python environment.
The game will start, and you will see the current round number displayed on the screen.
The game will continue until one player has all the cards.

## Learning Objectives

This project was created to practice OOPS concepts in Python, such as class definitions, object instantiation, and method calls. It helped in understanding the use of classes and objects to create more complex programs, as well as how to use these concepts to model real-world scenarios.

## Acknowledgments
The code in this project is based on an exercise from the "Complete Python Bootcamp" course on Udemy, created by Jose Portilla. Special thanks to the instructor for providing the inspiration and guidance to complete this project.
